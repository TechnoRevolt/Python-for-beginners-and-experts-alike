    <h4> LEARNING PYTHON BY BEING CRITICAL!</h4><br><br>
    " The Governments suppress the true freedom of expression since those who occupy them deliberately murder intellectual liberties because they want the people to follow the conventions that they created reducing humans into robots. We do not live in a DEMOCRACY but DICTATORSHIP masquerading behind the veil of the so called FREEDOM out from their hegemonic illusions."<br>

    <p>Learning Python is an adventure comparable with backpacking across the globe in pursuit of acquiring new dimensions and so with Python, there are new frontiers to discover where boring stuffs shoud be automated with the use of dynamic codes that can be executed immediately and faster than any other programming languages.Not only that Python is easy to learn with its syntax written as if just writing an English and it is very popular among the young entrepreneurs, among the adventurous spirits who want to put coding culture into a new degree and  among the data analysts.Python's popularity in AI (Artificial Intelligence), Machine learning and Data Science is its primary driver for its unstoppable growth.<br><br>
      Just most recently, Universities in the Philippines such as Ateneo De Manila University introduced Python due to its versatility.It is a productive programming language for automating huge statistics in spreadsheets, CSV or any data comprising of multiple rows and columns.Working with Python is a bliss in itself, it has loads of third party modules accessible to its own humongous library developed by the Pythonistas who dedicated their lives not only for the successof the programming language per se but also to ease the lives of the aspiring programmers to solve the daily problems confronting the humanity.<br><br>
   The Python community is not hostile to novice programmers because of the prevailing sense of brotherhood  among the developers.This is also one of the main factors that attracted more people into the community.

							<section class = "introduction">
								<p> Have you ever tried asking yourself even once? Why should I learn Python? This question might be alright yet you should ask yourself this way then.Why should not I?<br><br>
						Hi, my name is Avi Gabrielle Ben  - Pansensoy, I will be your digital instructor for this Python course.<br><br>
						To begin with , Python is the fastest growing programming language from 2015 until the next decades or perhaps perpetually dut to its flexibility. It is also the easiest programming language to learn without requiring so much of those boring syntax  'syntaxes' that might be prone to loads of errors. It is a stress-free experience of writing the coolest codes in Python for solving your problems or the dilemmas confronting the world around us. It is utilized by the engineers for robotics as well as for designing smart gadgets installed in any AI products.Since data scientists are handling big data for predictions and for implementing concrete analyses, there is no other programming language to handle such huge data but Python.It is also an ideal language for accountants who wants to automate spreadsheets with millions of rows,furthermore;even mathematicians apply it to solve complex mathemathical problems.
						'The job that can be done in a week before but it can be accomplished in less than a day with Python.' This gives an idea how dynamic the language is, kick that bad habit and start automating that boring world.
						What is so special  with Python that its popularity keeps on soaring higher leaving its competitors behind.<br><br><br><br>
						1)It can solve complex problems in less time with fewer lines of codes, if you are a programmer catching up with a deadline then Python is for you.<br><br>
						This is the reason why multi-billion dollar companies such as Google, Spotify , Facebook, Twitter and among the others are using Python to deliver their services straight right into the palms of their clients.<br><br>
						2)It can accomplish multiple tasks because it is a multi-purpose language that can work with data analysis, automation,hacking,missile interception,AI , Machine Learning,Web Apps, Desktop Apps and even smart gadgets.If the goal is to have a high paying salary,successful programmers  then Python will never disappoint those hopes.<br><br>
						3)It is a very high language.<br><br>
						4)A cross-platform that can operate with Windows, Linux, Mac and among the others.<br><br>
						5)It has a very huge community of developers who can help someone in web designing needs or programming codes.
						Ok ! That is all for the introduction, let us dive into the ocean of Python Codes . If you are a beginner, fear not and we will swim hand in hand to get all through these.<br><br>
						</p>
						</section>

						<section class = "example">
							<p> Why is it an easy langauge compared to the other programming languages?<br><br>
								Here are the few examples to acquire some comparative knowledge.<br><br>
								Let us suppose that we want to access a data from a common list in.<br><br>
								Digong_corrupt_allies = ["Gloria Macapalmuks Arroio","Jose Estrada Kulimbat","Robin 'Sili' Maybangdilla","Imeng 'KulamBarang' Marcosnakaw"]<br><br>
								The list like in any other languages is always zero - based  which means that the first index begins with zero, in Python accessing the data in the first index is to type simply like below.<br><br>
								print(Digong_corrupt-allies[0])<br><br>
								Gloria Macapalmuks Arroio will be executed immediately as the output of the code.<br><br>
								Very easy and straightforward.Isn't? this is just the beginning of the adventure.Without further ado, let us begin diging deeper into Python's core concepts!<br><br><br><br>
						</p>
						</section>

						<div class = "intro2">
						<p>First and foremost, head over to your browser;navigate into Python.org.Download the latest version,go to your download section and if you are in windows you must get into the checkbox below and add python to the path.
						</p>
						</div>


						<div class = "texteditor">
						<p> Are you excited?Well, I am very excited to teach you everything, if you are a beginner in programming then do not be intimidated; I will hold your hand and together we will walk all through these ordeals and there is one thing I want to tell you.This is an awesome adventure greater than you have expected, you will learn more techniques along the path and will allow you to manipulate your own programming skills that had never been taught in Schools as well as in any other Universities.
						  After the successful installation of Python of the latest version, it is time to install a code editor that will interpret our programs instantly,there are numerous code editors out there yet the most compatible code editor for Python is Pycharm.<br><br>
						  Steps in downloading and installing Pycharm:<br><br><br>
						  1) Go to your browser and navigate into the https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/.<br><br>
						     Pycharm is an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) which primarily is a code editor in steroids due to its dynamism.<br><br>
						  2)Please hit the download button, in the download page, there are 2 versions of Pycharm, 1 is the Professsional version and the other is the Community version, the former is paid while the latter is for free; download the Community version that we will gonna use in this tutorial.hit the next, then next and next button towards the successful installation.
						</p>
						</div>

						<div class = "open">
						  <p>3) Open the Pycharm code editor.<br><br>
						    4)Click the + create new project.<br><br>
						    5)Name your project according to the title you love most.<br><br>
						    6)Before hitting the Enter, navigate below and expand the base interpreter to be sure if Python is installed and if it is installed then press Enter.<br><br>
						    7)At the Pycharm, right click the folder you had named.<br><br>
						    8)Hit the new then navigate into the Python file and again name it according to he name you want but with .py as an extension, by convention all Python files should have it.<br><br>
						    9)Click ok button and you are ready to rock or write the coolest programs.

						<div class = "begin">
						<p>WORKING WITH LIST,TUPLE AND DICTIONARY:</p>
						</div><br><br>

						<div class = "tit">
						<h3>1) LIST</h3>
						</div>

						<div class = "list">
						  <p>List in Python is a collection of data stored in a variable.It is one of the simplest and most important data structures in Python Programming, it is essential in storing data.It is usually enclosed with square brackets and each item is separated by comma.A list is mutable, meaning you can change its contents.<br><br>


						  1)Simply printing the items inside the list.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  print(buy)<br>
						  The output is:<br>
						  ['potatoes', 'fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  2)Accessing the first data inside the list through indexing, the first data begins at ZERO<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  print(buy[0])<br>
						  potatoes = is the output.<br><br>

						  3)Accessing the last data by indexing with -1, the last data as a norm is always at the -1<br><br>

						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>

						  print(buy[-1])<br>

						  vegetables = is the output.<br><br>

						  4)Replacing the item inside the list.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  buy [0] = 'dried fish'<br>
						  print(buy)<br>
						  ['dried fish', 'fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables'] is the output.<br><br>

						  5)Deleting an item.<br><br>
						  del buy[0]<br><br>
						  print(buy)<br>
						  ['fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  6)Adding an item.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  buy.append('bagoong')
						  print(buy)
						  ['potatoes', 'fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables', 'bagoong']<br><br>

						  7)Inserting an item right at the desired index.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  buy.insert(3, 'bell peppers')
						  print(buy)
						  ['potatoes', 'fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'bell peppers', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  8)Removing an item within the list.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  buy.remove('fresh fishes')<br>
						  print(buy)<br>

						  ['potatoes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  9)Combining data or 2 lists<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  new = buy + leave<br>
						  print (new)<br>
						  ['potatoes', 'fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables', 'red mussels', 'rotten oysters', 'frozen meat', 'muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  10)Accessing data in both lists.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  a = buy[0],leave[1]<br>
						  print(a)<br>
						  'potatoes', 'rotten oysters')<br><br>

						  11)Adding a sentence or a statement.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  print('Please do include',buy [0])<br>

						  Please do include potatoes.<br><br>

						  12)Accessing a data  and with it are two added statements.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  print('Please do not forget to buy',buy [1], 'for our dinner.')<br>

						  Please do not forget to buy fresh fishes for our dinner.<br><br>

						  13)Accessing data from the buy list from index 1 to index 4 and from index 0 to 1<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  print(buy[1: 4])<br>
						  print(leave[0:1])<br><br>
						['fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions']<br>
						['red mussels']<br><br>


						  14)Creating a list with lists within it.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  items = [buy,leave]<br>
						  print(items)<br>
						  [['potatoes', 'fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables'], ['red mussels', 'rotten oysters', 'frozen meat', 'muriatic acid']]<br><br>

						  15)Sorting items inside the list.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  buy.sort()<br>
						  print(buy)<br>

						  ['fresh fishes', 'onions', 'potatoes', 'tomatoes', 'vegetables']<br><br>

						  16)Reverse sorting.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  buy.reverse()<br>
						  print(buy)<br>

						  ['vegetables', 'onions', 'tomatoes', 'fresh fishes', 'potatoes']<br><br>

						  17)Counting the number of items inside the list.<br><br>

						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  print(len(buy))<br>
						  5 = is the output.<br><br>

						  18)Accessing the maximum and the minimum, the maximum is the last item in alphabetical order and the minimum is always the minimum in the alphabetical order.<br><br>
						  buy = ['potatoes','fresh fishes', 'tomatoes', 'onions', 'vegetables']<br>
						  leave = ['red mussels','rotten oysters','frozen meat','muriatic acid']<br><br>

						  print(max(buy))<br>
						  print(min(leave))<br><br>

						  print(max(buy))<br>
						  print(min(leave))<br><br>

						  19) Organizing the items with their corresponding elements.<br><br>
						  import itertools<br><br>
						  Vegetables = ['Tomatoes', 'Onions','Cabbage', 'Bunch of Water Spinach','Lemons','Garlics','Fresh Fishes']<br>
						  Prices = ['80 per kilo','160 per kilo', '120 per kilo','10 per bunch','150 per kilo','220 per kilo'' 200 per kilo']<br><br>

						  a = tuple(zip(Vegetables,Prices))<br>
						  print(a)<br><br>
						  (('Tomatoes', '80 per kilo'), ('Onions', '160 per kilo'), ('Cabbage', '120 per kilo'), ('Bunch of Water Spinach', '10 per bunch'), ('Lemons', '150 per kilo'), ('Garlics', '220 per kilo 200 per kilo'))<br><br>

						  20)Juxtaposition with pandas.<br><br>
						  import pandas as pd<br><br>

						  a = pd.Series (['Tomatoes', 'Onions', 'Cabbage', 'Water Spinach','Lemons','Garlics','Fishes'], index = ['120 per kilo', '160 per kilo','180 per kilo','10 per bunch',
						                  '180 per kilo','220 per kilo','240 per kilo'])<br><br>

						  print(a)<br><br>

						             }<br><br>

						Celsius = (Fahrenheit['Mild_Fever'] - 32) * 5/9<br>
						print(Celsius)<br><br>

						23)Programming in dictionaries.<br><br>

						Let us assume of going into a supermarket and buy some ingredients for pasta bolognnaisse.<br><br>

						1)Create a dictionary and store all the necessary ingredients in a variable called groceries.<br><br>

						groceries = {'Pasta Fettuccinne' : 150, 'Tomatoes' : 140, 'Groundbeef': 200, 'Onions' : 160, 'Parmesan': 120,
						             'Oliveoil' : 180, 'Driedbasil' : 110,'Carrots' : 80,'Redwine' : 1200,'SaltandPepper': 50,'FreshMushrooms':120,
						              'Celery' : 165}<br><br>



						Enumerating the items inside the basket.<br><br>
						for items in groceries:<br>
						    print(items)<br>

						The result of the program:<br><br>

						Pasta Fettuccinne<br>
						Tomatoes<br>
						Groundbeef<br>
						Onions<br>
						Parmesan<br>
						Oliveoil<br>
						Driedbasil<br>
						Carrots<br>
						Redwine<br>
						SaltandPepper<br>
						FreshMushrooms<br>
						Celery<br.<br>

						 Calculating the sum of all the prices of the grocery items.<br><br>


						for values in groceries.values():<br>
						    print(values)<br>



						print(sum(groceries.values()))<br>
						2675<br><br>


						To Achieve this the quotation marks in the numbers should be remove to make them integers and not strings.<br>

						You called your dad and told him about all the items bough but he insisted that items such as Frenchbread and Pancdetta should be added into the basket.<br>

						Create another dictionary.<br><br>


						new_item = {'FrenchBread' : 260, 'Pancetta' : 320}<br><br>

						groceries.update(new_item)<br>
						print(groceries)<br>
						print(sum (groceries.values()), 'is the new price that you have to pay.')<br><br>




						24)Accessing and calculating the information within the dictionary or dictionaries.<br><br>
						supplies = {'Jackhammer': 6500, 'Powersaw' : 18000, 'Electricdrill': 12000, 'stabilizer' : 8000, 'Sonar' : 500000, 'Superlight' : 15000,
						            'Fishfinder' : 23000, 'Underwater' : 32000}<br><br>

						discount = { 'Holiday': .10, 'Christmascut' : .20}<br><br>


						Bonanza = supplies['Jackhammer'] * discount['Holiday']<br>
						print(Bonanza)
						Bonanza_price = supplies['Jackhammer'] - Bonanza<br>
						print(Bonanza_price)<br><br>


						25)Determining the maximum death toll in a certain month and year,or use this in any other dictionary.<br><br>
						Kill = Duterte_Murder = {'Jul2016' : 1260, 'Aug2016' : 814, 'Sept2016' : 743, 'Oct216' : 1675, 'Nov2016' : 446, 'Dec2016': 228, 'Jan217' : 154,
